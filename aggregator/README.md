# The Logging Wrap
The logging wrap is a simple dispatcher of messages, with pre-defined level of importance (debug, info, warn, error). Messages are forwarded to all implementations of the [`wrapscan.io/polywrap/logger@1.0`](../logger/interface/) interface. If no implementations are found, messages will simply not be forwarded.
